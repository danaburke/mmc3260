    <p>Dana Burke â€” it's a name that is bound for the high-gloss pages of your favorite magazine.</p>
    <p>First and foremost, I am a wordsmith. I know when to use who and whom, the difference between that and which, and how to properly attribute in an article. The AP Stylebook is my bible. I aim to tell stories that are clear and accurate while being entertaining and informative.</p>
    <p>My creativity extends far beyond the letters A through Z. At 15, I received my first DSLR camera. Falling in love with photography, I enrolled in the commercial photography program at McFatter Technical Center. There I learned the ins and outs of film, studio lighting, digital photography and photo manipulation. I graduated as a certified photographer and an Adobe certified associate in visual communication.</p>
    <p>Combining my love of language with my passion for strong images, I am pursuing a degree in journalism at the University of Florida. Currently, I am the editor in chief of UF's Orange & Blue Magazine.</p>
    <p>This past summer, I spent my workdays between MTV and Town & Country magazine, interning with the off-air creative team and the fashion editoral team, respectively. Previously, I worked at The Independent Florida Alligator, the nation's largest student-run newspaper, as the entertainment editor and the photo editor. I have also worked for Ology.com, The Boca Raton Observer Magazine and Teenlink South Florida, a publication of the Sun Sentinel.</p>
    <p>Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> with any questions, compliments, story ideas, job offers or online coupon codes (I'm a sucker for a good sale).</p>

<p>Off the record: My favorite color is black. People watching is the best pastime. I'll never say no to cookies.</p>
